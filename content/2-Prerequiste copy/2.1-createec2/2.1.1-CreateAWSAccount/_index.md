### 1. Create AWS Account (if you don't have one)

#### 1.1. Access AWS Console

- Go to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
- If you already have an AWS account, you can log in right away. If not, create a new account.

#### 1.2. Register Account with Personal Email

- Select **Create a new AWS account**.
- Enter your **personal email** and a **secure password**. AWS requires the password to be at least 8 characters long and include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers.
- After filling in the registration details, you'll need to enter your account name and personal information such as address and phone number.

#### 1.3. Activate Account and Set Up Billing

- **Activate the account**:
  - AWS will ask you for payment information (credit or debit card) to activate your account. This is required to pay for the services you use on AWS, although you’ll have a free trial package for the first 12 months.
  - Enter your **payment information** and **confirm your address**.

- **Account verification**:
  - AWS requires you to complete a security verification step through phone to protect your account. You will receive a PIN via phone to enter into the AWS Console.

- **Choose a service plan**:
  - After verifying your account, you’ll be prompted to choose a service plan, which can be either the personal or business plan. Be sure to choose the **Basic Support** plan unless you want to use a paid support service.

- **Complete registration**:
  - After completing registration and verification, you’ll receive a confirmation email from AWS.
  - Your account will be activated and ready to use.

- **Log in and use**:
  - Log in to the **AWS Console** using the newly created account and start deploying AWS services.
